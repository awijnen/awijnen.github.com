<p>As an EE major I enjoyed dabbling with hardware. Nice and tangible. However, for some strange reason, I consistently cringed at the thought of writing a line of code. </p>

<p>The fact that the first programming class I ever took was an introduction to JAVA might have something to do with that. Thanks a lot Alma Mater! You managed to disinterest me in the one field that'll literally shake up every industry in the foreseeable future. Code was my kryptonite. Yet I look ridiculous in spandex, I would die if I jumped out of a window, and I don't have a twelve pack.</p>

<p>Luckily, I found the light.</p>

<p>Last year, with the advent of amazing initiatives like Team Treehouse, CodeSchool, and Codecademy, the programming education was disrupted. Early 2012, together with 450,000 others, I pledged to add a new skill to my repertoire. To add some fuel to the fire, I took a four-month sabbatical to start off 2013 to attend the Flatiron School.</p>

<p>I feel strongly about the need to achieve code literacy. Here are four reasons why I think you should too:</p>
<strong>1. Economic value</strong>
<p>Every industry is being disrupted by software. Amazon punched Borders in the face so hard they stayed down. iTunes, Spotify, and Pandora are reducing record labels to ‘dumb’ content farms. These are just two examples where software is engulfing large parts of an industry’s value chain.  It’s happening in every industry. Old- and new-skool. Marc Andreessen described it best: ‘Software is eating the world’.</p>

<strong>2. Freedom</strong>
<p>Do you know what it takes to write a web or mobile application? A computer. That’s it. Yes, you probably need an outlet to charge it too. But that’s really it. You can code at home, from your local Starbucks, the office, on a plane, or while sitting on your grandma’s couch. Now that’s what I call freedom. Compare that to the cost and effort of setting up any traditional brick-and-mortar business.</p>

<strong>3. Community</strong>
<p>There are plenty of stereotypes floating around describing your average programmer. Like any stereotype, they all hold some truth. That being said, I think comradery and a sense of community are what define programmers the most. They are literally always available to help. Just browse over to Stack Overflow if you don’t believe me. There’s even a free Rails Hotline for crying out loud.</p>

<strong>4. Creativity</strong>
<p>Finally, coding is an art. It’s a form of expression. Just like writing, composing, or painting. You are presented with a blank slate, and anything is possible from that point on. I strongly feel creativity behaves like muscle does. Flexing them regularly makes you stronger, faster, leaner. Programming will sharpen your mind. Apply it however way you want.</p>


<strong>Conclusion</strong>
<p>Code literacy is at an abysmally low level today. Why? Children and adolescents are not properly stimulated to pick up programming from a young age. It’s a shame, since software is eating the world, taking over large parts of the value chain in nearly every industry.</p>

<p>We don’t need more bankers, consultants, brokers, or other types of information-shufflers. We need people that can build. Learn how to code. Now!</p>
